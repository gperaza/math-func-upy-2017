* Description
This is an introductory mathematics course that covers precalculus topics and
some vector algebra including an introduction to vector spaces.

*Objective:* The student will develop mathematical models using tools from
analytic geometry, trigonometry and vector algebra to contribute to the solution
of problems in their environment and the basic sciences.

*Quarter:* Second

*Hours per week:* 4

*Total hours:* 60

*Prerequisites:* Basic algebra.

*Professor:* Gonzalo G. Peraza Mues

* Outline
The curse will be structured in 3 mayor units with corresponding subtopics. For
each topic, course time is divided in hours for theory (saber) and hours for
practice (saber hacer).

     chapters of this book.
** Support references
This book are provided as optional reference material. They cover roughly the
same topics and include a great number of practice exercises. Neither of them
was chosen as the main book because they all of them exceed the 1000 pages
count, far more than a typical student can absorb in a single quarter.

* Grading
The course is divided in 3 periods following roughly the 3 main units described
in the outline. Each period will consist of several sets of homework problems
and an exam. Per period grading is as follows:
 - 40% Homework
 - 60% Exam

Exam dates and topics will be posted on the Lectures page.

* Homework
Homework will be posted in the course page after the corresponding lecture. All
homework must be delivered the indicated date (typically one week after posting)
without exception and must follow these guidelines:
 - White pages.
 - A front page with name, group, date and homework number clearly stated.
 - Pages stapled together.
 - All exercises must be clearly delimited with the solution following the
   instruction. The solution must be clearly written and easy to follow.

Solutions will be posted after the delivery date for each homework.
* Class regulations

* Advice to studying
Do all your homework, read the textbook when assigned to, and dedicate at least
another 8 hours to the course outside of class. Practice, practice,
practice. Ask, ask, ask.
